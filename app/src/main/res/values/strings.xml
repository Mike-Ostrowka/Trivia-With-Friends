   clicking play, or play against an opponent with Play With Friends.<br/><br/>
<b> How do I change my password? </b>     You can change your password in the setting page, along with
changing in-game settings such as your sound.<br/><br/><b>How do I chat with friends?</b>    You can post
to the global chat room to talk with everyone, post in your own chat room to talk to your friends or assigned chat mates,
or post on your friends pages to talk with them.<br/><br/><b>How is the game scored?</b>    Players are given no points for a wrong answer, and
 (10 - time taken) points for a correct answer. For example, a 4 second answer would be worth 10 - 4
