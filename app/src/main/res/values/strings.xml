  <string name="faq_text"> <![CDATA[<b>How do I start a game?:</b>   You can start a solo game by
   clicking play, or play against an opponent with Play With Friends.<br/><br/>
<b> How do I change my password? </b>     You can change your password in the setting page, along with
changing in-game settings such as your sound.<br/><br/><b>What are lifelines?</b>    Lifelines are power-ups
that can swing the game in your favor! They have the ability to either hurt your opponent or to help
you.<br/><br/><b>How is the game scored?</b>    Players are given no points for a wrong answer, and
 (10 - time taken) points for a correct answer. For example, a 4 second answer would be worth 10 - 4
 = 6 points<br/><br/><b>App Credits:</b>   Mike Ostrowka, Tanner Langan, Randy Gill, Jaden Yu<br/><br/>
